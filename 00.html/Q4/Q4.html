       <h1> The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>


 <h2>Early Computers </h2>
The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b>
such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the 
<u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept 
of a programmable computer</strong>.

<h2>Generations of Computers </h2>
The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has 
evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, 
while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.
By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal 
and affordable</em>.

<h3>Mathematics in Computing </h3>
A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>
Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.

<h2>Birth of the Internet </h2>
The WWW was invented by
Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
<blockquote>
   "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
   Access by everyone regardless of disability is 
   an essential aspect." 
   – <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
</blockquote>

<h2> Modern Era</h2>
Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and 
fiber connections. Computers now fit in our 
<small>pockets as smartphones</small>.

<h2>Computer Example</h2>
To display text on a webpage, you can use: <br><pre>
