   <pre> 🌅 Bali Vibes in a Few Lines

- “Where the sunsets paint poetry and the waves whisper peace—Bali is a feeling, not just a place.”
- “Temples in the mist, rice fields that stretch like dreams, and a rhythm that slows the soul.”
- “In Bali, even silence feels sacred. Every breeze carries a blessing.”
- “From Ubud’s jungle calm to Seminyak’s beach buzz—Bali balances chaos and calm like a dance.”
