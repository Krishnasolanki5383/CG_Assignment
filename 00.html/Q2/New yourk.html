           ðŸ—½  New York City, often called "The Big Apple," is a dazzling mosaic of cultures,
            ambition, and architectural marvels. From the towering skyscrapers of 
            Manhattan to the artistic pulse of Brooklyn, every borough has its own rhythm 
            and soul. It's a city where Wall Street buzzes with financial energy, Broadway 
            dazzles with theatrical brilliance, and Central Park offers a green escape 
            amid the urban rush. Known for its diversity, NYC is home to people from every 
            corner of the globe, creating a vibrant tapestry of languages, cuisines, and 
            traditions. Whether you're marveling at the Statue of Liberty, strolling 
            through Times Square, or catching a sunset from the Brooklyn Bridge, New York 
            never stops movingâ€”and never stops inspiring.
